    <h3>STEPS FOR MAKING POTATO</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut: Dice potatoes into even 1-inch or 2-inch chunks so they cook at the
        same rate
      </li>
      <li>
        Start with Cold Water: Place potatoes in a pot and cover them with at
        least 1–2 inches of cold water.
      </li>
      <li>Season: Add a generous amount of salt to the water.</li>
      <li>
        Boil: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until
        "fork-tender" (usually 10–15 minutes), meaning a fork slides in and out
        with no resistance.
